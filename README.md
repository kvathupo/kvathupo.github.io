## What?
A dumping ground for Professor Bravo's CMSC320 final project 
assignment.

We apply Arbitrage Pricing Theory to determine if such a valuation model 
for US equities can outperform randomized stock picks. Of note, we achieved
an annual return of 32.3% in test year 2017.

## Who?
Jared Gill and Kalinda Vathupola
## Where?

not tied to Kalinda's github page.
